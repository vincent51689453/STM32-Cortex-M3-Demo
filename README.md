Here is a list of demo programs of individual pheripherals:

1) Basic GPIO
2) Basic GPIO with external interrupt
3) USART with receive interrupt
4) Independet watchdog
5) Pulse Width Module Generation with TIMER
6) Reading multiple channels of ADC with DMA
7) Serial Plotter with UART messages
8) TIMER interrupt
